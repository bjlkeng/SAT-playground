# NEXT PLAN — 2026-08-04 (supersedes 2026-08-02; PRUNED)

One-file plan for the next clear context. SESSIONS 4-13 bodies live in git
history (`git log -p plan/next-plan.md` up to 52a8f95); SESSIONS 14b/14c/14d
bodies were pruned this revision — full text in revisions up to 93ab682, and
their verdicts survive in "Standing traps", "Closed lines", and the solver
README "Current State" entries. Where this file contradicts an older revision,
THIS file wins.

**START HERE:** read "SESSION 15" below, then "RANKED PLAN", then "Standing
traps".

## SESSION 15 (2026-08-02/04) — banded vivify-deduce PROMOTED: full-bench 276 → 279/400 (gate PASS, A/B WIN +5/−2); backbone.c port landed and measured a no-op (free rider, default off)

Full-bench A/B `log/abtest-cand-vs-base-2026-08-03-10-13-35` (400x2 @3600 s
/16 GB/32 cores, simultaneous start, proofs verified, gate PASS, zero
contradictions / zero correctness failures):

| arm | solved | conf(own solved) | PAR-2 |
|---|:--:|--:|--:|
| cand (`SAT_VIVIFY_DEDUCE=on`, banded) | **279/400** | 532.9M | 1,041,267 |
| base (SESSION 14d defaults) | 276/400 | 554.7M | 1,057,324 |

**Gained (+5):** Circuit_multiplier24 (SAT 1917 s, FAT margin — a named
walk-scale gap cell), BubbleVsPancakeSort_7_6 (UNSAT 2274 s, FAT margin — gap
family), valves-gates + bp4_TCO_IXA_FPBLE_ZR + bp4_BC012_IXA_LPI (banked cells
base dropped this deal; retained/recovered). **Lost (−2):**
MVRoundRobin_n14_d10_v2 (base margin 82 s = thin wall coin) and
sum_of_3_cubes_37_bits_87 (REAL SAT reroll: base solved at its stable
894,247-conflict trajectory — identical in 3 prior deals — while deduce
changed cand's deal; expect it to flip back some deals). Tier-2: −14.7M
conflicts across the 37 changed both-solved cells; the mechanism cells all
shortened 10-30% (sqrt-mitern169 −1.43M, lec_mult −1.10M, boothbit29 −0.96M,
oddball_19 −3.94M, PancakeVsSelection_6_8 −3.61M, ER_400 −3.28M; worst
regression case11 +5.0M, still solved).

**What shipped (commits a1bbb5f, 2549801, + the promotion commit):**

1. **`SAT_VIVIFY_DEDUCE` default ON, banded** (the promotion). The kissat
   `vivify_deduce` reason-cone mechanism was built 2026-07-15 and shelved
   after the UNBANDED armed screen lost on EARLY armers (ibm +133% conflicts,
   oski20 +146 s). SESSION 15 added `SAT_VIVIFY_DEDUCE_ARMED_MIN=500_000`
   (the SESSION 14d reduce-law arming-time discriminator): deduce fires only
   where `inprocess_armed_at_conflict >= 500k`, so TT/oski/vex/oddball-class
   banked early armers are byte-identical BY CONSTRUCTION (miterded screen:
   all five canaries conflict-EXACT; identity refs digit-exact). Mechanism:
   boothdadda29 probe @2.5M conflicts — vivify hit rate 14.8% → 28.5%
   (kissat 34%), strengthened 27,491 → 53,823, wall 318 → 311 s.
2. **`src/backbone.rs` — full kissat backbone.c port, default OFF.**
   Stacked-probe failed-literal rounds over a private binary-implication-graph
   propagator, BIG-UIP analysis, RUP units through the learn_lucky path,
   kissat-parity flags/rounds/2%-effort. Tier-1 on the miter class: **ZERO
   units found — and kissat's own backbone finds 2 units there** (its 341k
   backbone ticks are cadence, not content). This re-confirms the 2026-07-15
   "killed without building" verdict buried in commit 038f9c1 — the ranked
   backbone item in earlier plan revisions was STALE. The pass is a
   zero-mutation zero-cost rider (bb arm conflict-identical to base on all
   23 screen cells): keep OFF; only re-arm if a family with a RICH binary
   implication graph (large edge count + failed-literal yield) shows up.
3. **Tier decomposition that found the real lever (boothdadda29, identical
   2.5M-conflict horizon):** solver12 318 s / 23.9G search ticks vs kissat
   145 s / 6.97G — 3.4x ticks (49 v 26 ticks/prop AND 194 v 108
   props/conflict) with kissat vivifying 6.5x more clauses (179,349 v
   27,491) and walking only 0.12% of wall. Deduce closes part of the
   hit-rate hole; the residual rate gap (still ~2x wall on miters) is the
   #1 remaining mechanism target.

Screens: miterded 4-arm (`log/abtest-ded-vs-bbded-vs-bb-vs-base-2026-08-02-
17-45-21`, 23 cells @3600 s): ded 8/23 v base 7/23 (gained sqrt-mitern169;
boothbit29 8.97M → 8.01M conf), bb ≡ base conflict-exact, bbded ≡ ded
conflict-exact (no antagonism, no backbone contribution). New suite:
`benchmarks/miterded-2026-08-02` (23 cells = miterarmed-2026-08-01 + sqrt169
+ lec_mult + boothdadda28/29 + mult16_22). Validation: 756+5 tests (+13 this
session), smoke 9/9, rbsat 100001/196258/17,758,017 + MVRR 267,199
digit-exact both flag states.

## SESSIONS 14b/14c/14d (2026-07-29..08-02) — pruned summaries

- **14d (280/400, +4/−0):** banded `SAT_REDUCE_FRACTION_ARMED` (+ `_MIN=500k`
  arming-time band — the discriminator SESSION 15 reused) un-blinded the
  reduce law on late-armed miters: FIRST-EVER 16x16 miter solve (boothbit29),
  + sqrt-mitern169/lec_mult/shuffling-1. Also `SAT_REPHASE_ARMED_ONLY=off` +
  `SAT_WALK_EFFORT_UNARMED=200`. Full text: rev 93ab682.
- **14c (277/400, +6/−0):** php-detector coverage — inductive PHP proof
  engine (Cook's ER reduction, ~H^4 lines v factorial), direct-php detection,
  AMO-connectivity partition voting, parse-time structure stash: 5 first-ever
  both-timeout hard-core cells (cliquecoloring/clqcl/fphp/rphp). Full text:
  rev d838757.
- **14b (271/400, +10/−4):** three runaway-pass bugs fixed (sweep-kitten
  unlimited budget, gauss ordering spin + 31 GB fill-in, mid-giant BVE 8 GiB
  arena doubling) + `SAT_REDUCE_FRACTION` default ON + thresholded `SAT_ELS`
  ON + root-pass scoping law (percent-mass decline-is-identity gates are the
  ONLY shippable root-pass shape). Full text: rev 416adae.

## RANKED PLAN (2026-08-04)

1. **Miter rate parity, phase 2 (the #1 family: ~9 kissat-only 16x16 cells +
   Circuit_multiplier29 + both-timeout siblings).** Deduce landed; the
   residual is still ~2x wall at equal conflicts. Ordered candidate levers,
   all bandable to the late-armed class: (a) `SAT_VIVIFY_SORT` (built,
   default off, never screened post-deduce — shares deduce's scope and
   raises implied-density per attempt); (b) vivify tier3 volume — kissat's
   3:3:1:3 split vivifies tier3+irredundant which we never touch;
   SAT_VIVIFY_TIER_SPLIT is a CLOSED LINE from a pre-deduce screen, so
   re-measure ONLY as "deduce+tier3" with the band, screen on miterded; (c)
   ticks/prop diet — 49 v kissat 26 at identical conflicts is watch/DB
   mechanics, needs a fresh profile probe (gdb SIGINT sampler) on
   boothdadda29 to find where the 2x per-prop cost sits.
2. **Deal-variance recapture (free +1-2 some deals):** sum_of_3_cubes and
   MVRR-n14 are now coin/reroll cells (see traps); no work — judge them as
   coins in future A/Bs. valves-gates/bp4 pair flips the other way.
3. **SWEEP_SUBST behind a percent-mass threshold (uniqinv40-class).** Same
   decline-is-identity shape as the ELS threshold; uniqinv40 needs ~30%
   sweep-substitution mass. Screen on frontier + miterded canaries.
4. **Medium-1800 re-baseline (bookkeeping, OVERDUE — two promotions since
   74/100 at c469b03).** Run the standard medium single-seed A/B (current
   defaults vs 14d-with-deduce-off) at 1800 s before any medium-metric work.
   Exposure: deduce needs >=500k-conflict arming — most medium cells never
   get there; verify with the identity refs.
5. **Walk-scale SAT cells (~5 left: Circuit_multiplier29, ITC x2, HCP-446,
   ER_400.apx_1):** Circuit24 fell to deduce (not walk). Re-read the walk
   ledger before any effort tuning; lottery-adjacent.
6. **Starved hwmcc/BMC class (b18/b19, goldcrest, fixedbandwidth, x-epic,
   nla-digbench, oski15a10b10s, oisc):** CLOSED at current mechanism level
   (tick-cadence pipeline measured negative twice). Needs a genuinely new
   idea, not a flag.
7. **Checker-timeout proof-size arc (5 at-risk solves: boothbit29,
   valves-gates, ncc, grs-160-48, VexRiscv)** — track only; valves-gates
   joined the class this session.

## Current state

- HEAD: SESSION 15 promotion commit (after 2549801).
  **Full-bench 3600 s baseline: 279/400** (cand TSV =
  `log/abtest-cand-vs-base-2026-08-03-10-13-35/cand/results.tsv`).
  kissat 4.0.4 reference: 296/400 (`log/kissat-full-20260729-210758`) —
  **gap −17** (was −25 at 14b). kissat-only 53 / solver12-only 36 /
  both-timeout 68.
- **Same-defaults deal variance at 3600 s full bench is ±2-4 solved**: the
  14d defaults scored 280 (08-01 deal) and 276 (08-03 deal) on identical
  config — weigh raw full-bench solved deltas accordingly (the paired A/B
  inside ONE deal is the real signal).
- **Medium-1800 s baseline: still NEEDS RE-MEASUREMENT (ranked item 4);
  last measured 74/100 at c469b03 (pre-bundle, pre-deduce).**
- Default surface added this session: SAT_VIVIFY_DEDUCE=on +
  SAT_VIVIFY_DEDUCE_ARMED_MIN=500000; SAT_BACKBONE=off (+ SCOPE/ARMED_MIN/
  EFFORT/TICKS/ROUNDS/MAX_ROUNDS knobs, all inert by default).
- Suites: `benchmarks/miterded-2026-08-02` (23 cells, miter targets + banked
  canaries — the standard screen for late-armed-band candidates),
  `benchmarks/frontier-2026-07-30` (38 cells), miterarmed-2026-08-01 (18).

## Standing traps (updated 2026-08-04 + carried)

- **SESSION 15:** the ranked-plan backbone item was STALE — commit 038f9c1
  (2026-07-15) had already killed it with kissat -s profiles; CHECK COMMIT
  MESSAGES of groundwork commits before re-ranking an old idea. Coin list
  additions: sum_of_3_cubes_37_bits_87 (SAT; stable 894,247-conflict
  trajectory when deduce-untouched, rerolls under any late-armed-band
  feature), MVRR_n14_d10_v2 (82-720 s margins at 3600 s, deep grinder at the
  wall). valves-gates is now ALSO a checker-timeout cell (verify caveat).
  4-arm screens at 3600 s on 23 cells run ~10.5 h wall, not ~3 h — plan
  accordingly; 400x2 full A/B ran ~15 h with verification.
- **SESSION 14b (carried):** NEVER `cargo build` the solver dir while ANY
  feature_ablation run is live — build to a scratch CARGO_TARGET_DIR or copy
  the binary out first. `pkill -f` with a self-matching pattern kills your
  own shell — use the `[b]racket` trick. ELS threshold gates ONLY the root
  standalone pass. `SAT_WALK` env name is PARKED (denylist).
- **SESSION 14b (carried):** reduce-law deep-cell coin exposure at 3600 s:
  rbsat/case6/170223547-class. Judge as coins, not capability.
- **SESSION 14 (carried):** full-bench 3600 s and medium-1800 s are separate
  ledgers. `ulimit -v` kills on VIRTUAL memory. rc-6 = allocator abort.
  SAT_LIMIT_WALL_SEC honored only in the CDCL loop.
- **Carried (SESSIONS 4-13):** deal noise ±2 medium; conflicts deterministic
  across load, wall is not; marginal-cell TIMEOUT untrustworthy under 32-way
  contention (solves ARE trustworthy); flipper list rbsat / vex / oski15 /
  VdW-22 (+case6, 170223547, sum_of_3_cubes, MVRR-n14 at 3600 s); activity
  proxies mislead; FEATURES.md/CONFIG_SCHEMA.csv are STALE (read
  src/config.rs + main.rs env reads); results.tsv written at run END; stats
  JSON on stderr, timed-out runs emit none (SAT_LIMIT_CONFLICTS probes);
  heredoc scratch writes flake — use the Write tool; perf blocked (gdb
  SIGINT sampler); `rm -rf` guarded — timestamped scratch dirs.
- **Carried ER/proof laws:** RAT-scan law (verify cost = #definitions x
  maxVar); residue/retry law (never stream an aborted ER attempt);
  deletions are load-bearing; tseitin caps legacy; SAT_TSEITIN_SNAKE off.
- **Carried closed lines (do not reopen without new mechanism):**
  starved-cell tick-cadence pipeline; unscoped root ELS/PROBE/SWEEP_ROOT
  defaults; SAT_ELIM_DEF; vivify tier-split AS A STANDALONE (SESSION 15
  exception: may re-screen as deduce+tier3 inside the late-armed band,
  ranked item 1b); gbve-adopter rounds; units-only transitive; per-mille
  RANKING thresholds (percent-mass decline-is-identity gates are the
  exception); ramsey ER emission; st_659; SAT_BACKBONE default-on (zero
  yield everywhere measured — miters, and 07-15 Bubble/fixedband profiles).

## solver12's capability edge (protect in rerolls)

New this session: **Circuit_multiplier24** (SAT 1917 s; kissat-only before),
**BubbleVsPancakeSort_7_6** (UNSAT 2274 s, fat margin). Carried first-evers:
MVRoundRobin_n14_d10_v2 (NOW A COIN — protect but expect flips),
RoundRobin_n18_d15, at-least-two-vmpc_28, rphp5_050/085, clqcl_40/50_6_5 + 5
cliquecoloring siblings (SAT_PHP_REFUTE, reroll-immune), xor_op x2
(SAT_GAUSS), tseitin_n188_d3, RoundRobin_n15-n17 + MVRR x3 (gate-BVE),
oddball-tto_zp x4 + TT_C496 + TT_C406 (endgame/arming; protected by the
500k bands), Kakuro-132, HCP-529, frb80-14-1, valves-gates (checker-timeout
caveat), oddball_13_5_ttf, battleship, bivium, gto_p60, contest04,
reconf10_22, blockpuzzle, VdW-23, sted2var, bp4_BC012_IXA + bp4_TCO_IXA
(deal-marginal), boothbit29 + sqrt-mitern169 + lec_mult_CvW + shuffling-1
(14d, now deduce-accelerated 10-16%).
