# Solver 13 — kissat-rs

Faithful Rust reimplementation of kissat 4.0.4 (reference:
`benchmarks/reference-solvers/kissat-latest/`, built `gcc -O3 -DNDEBUG`).

- Plan and acceptance criteria: `plan/solver13-port-plan.md`
- Binding port conventions: `CONVENTIONS.md`
- Faithfulness oracle: `tools/parity.py` — diffs the deterministic `-s`
  statistics counters against the reference binary at fixed `--conflicts`
  limits. A faithful port matches exactly.

Goal: on `benchmarks/sat-comp-2025` (400 instances, 3600 s / 16 GB / 32
cores), solved count and PAR-2 within 2% of kissat 4.0.4 in a fresh paired
run, with all kissat features implemented.

Status: port in progress (foundation wave). This README records measured
results as they land; no benchmark claims yet.
